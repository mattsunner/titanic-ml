# Titanic ML Modeling

## About

This repository is a machine learning model implementation aiming to model the probability of survival for a given individual on the H.M.S Titanic. The data for this model was gathered from the Kaggle webiste and was used under given permissions. 

This model does not aim to generate novel results, but rather is being used to streghten various machine learning competencies, including:

- Writing clean model code
- Performing EDA and data cleaning steps
- Documenting code and decisions
- Developing a full machine learning model for packaging
